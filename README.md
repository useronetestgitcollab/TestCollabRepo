## Purpose of this repo

Personal training for using Git in a team environment. I am working simultaneously with two Git users sharing the same remote repository, simulating real-life team scenarios in order to strengthen my skills.
### Exercise 1

I will merge the `feature/AddReadmeContent` branch into `main`, resolving the conflicts that will arise when different contents of the `README.md` file are detected.
