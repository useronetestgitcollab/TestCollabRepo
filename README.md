## Purpose of this repo

Personal training for using Git in a team environment. I am working simultaneously with two Git users sharing the same remote repository, simulating real-life team scenarios in order to strengthen my skills.


### Exercise 1

I will merge the `feature/AddReadmeContent` branch into `main`, resolving the conflicts that will arise when different contents of the `README.md` file are detected.

### Exercise 2

Let's now try to `rebsae` main onto a branch, to add the contents of said branch to main. 
This content comes from the commit made on `feature/AddRebaseReadmeContent`.
This content comes from the commit made on `main`.

### Exercise 3

The same thing, but this time the branch was rebased onto `main` *before* `main` was rebased onto the branch. 
This is the commit from `main`.
This is the commit from `feature/AddRebase2ReadmeContent`.
